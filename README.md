# DaviScout
DaviScout is a restaurant sharing app. Although immature, this project helped me see the whole lifecycle of building a full-stack web application.
Specifically, this app includes

- A web app with CRUD functionality
- Express JS for routing, MongoDB for database management
- NodeJS to write server-side JavaScript
- Responsive pages using Bootstrap
- Basic authorization and authentication using Passport


## Demo
The rest will be filled out as the application is complete
## Deployment
